# Web Based Programming

## Online

The learning material is available online [here](https://uea-teaching.github.io/web-based-programming/)

I will make the slides available online and I will try to keep this material low-bandwidth.

## Building

The content is written in `Markdown` and converted using `pandoc`.
The slides are built using the Makefile in the lecture directory.
There is a corresponding Makefile in the labs directory.

I use some templates and defaults available at:

    https://github.com/uea-teaching/teaching-slides

I prefer to use Docker to run Pandoc, again the repo above has a Dockerfile.
There is also a Makefile in the root of this repo if you already have Docker installed.
